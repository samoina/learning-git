# GOING BACK TO BASICS - UNDERSTANDING GIT
This repository is all about going back to the basics of Git to have a deeper understanding, whilst creating new content for my blogpost on how to write a README.md file.

(Ideally, this section contains the name of the project and a brief description of the same. )

## Project Description
In this section, write about what the project does. What differentiates it from other similar projects? This is also a wonderful place to include any **Features** that are a highlight within the project.

## Badges
Some READMEs will feature tiny images that display certain data to your users. This data shows the state of documentation, and adds an aesthetic value to the README file.

## Project Status
This section is included if the project is incomplete. Consider highlighting some of the functionality achievable at that stage of development too.

## Project Screenshots
This section is largely dependent on what the project entails. Adding visuals, in form of images or GIFs helps users understand the project better.

## Installation
Outline the specific steps that one needs to follow to install your project. This reduces confusion and allows users to become better acquinted with the project. 

### Requirements
In this sub-section, be sure to include specifics such as whether the project runs on a select OS or has certain dependencies that must be added mnanually. 

## Usage
Add examples of how the project works to your README. This is incredibly important to allow users and anyone who'd want to contribute, get the gist of the project. Adding the least complicated usage is a good place to start. More complicated examples may be linked externally. 

## Project Context
Some developers call this section 'Reflections' and in it, address things such as:
- What was the context for the project? Learning a new framework? Experimenting with an idea? A passion project?
- What was the inspiration behind the project?
- What are some of the challenges encountered while creating this project?
- What were the unforeseen constraints?

## Technologies
What technologies have been used for the project implementation? This may seem obvious, but remember that the person using the project may be a novice and you want to accomodate them. In this section, highlight why you chose a specific language/framework over another. eg Why did you opt for vanilla Javascript instead of a framework? Or what makes MongoDB a preferred choice over another database management program such as SQL?

## Roadmap
Are there any future ideas for the project? This is where to list them in the README.


## Credits
This section is all about appreciating the people that made the project possible, possibly with links to their profiles

## License
If the project is open-sourced, it is important to say how it is licensed. This [link](https://choosealicense.com/) provides more information on how to choose an open source license. Remember, not including a license means that one retains all the rights to the source code, and copyright laws therefore apply. To remove ambiguity, it is best to include a license.
